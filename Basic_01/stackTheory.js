// Stack

// The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the
// principle of Last In First Out (LIFO)
// The last element inserted into the stack is first element to be removed
// removed from the stack.
// Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a
// mathematical model
// The Stack data structure supports two main operations
// Push, which adds an element to the collection
// Pop, which removes the most recently added element from the collection
