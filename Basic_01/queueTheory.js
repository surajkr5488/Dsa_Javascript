// Queue
// The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the
// principle of First In First Out (FIFO)
// The first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed
// A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the
// queue from the other end (front/ head).
// Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a
// mathematical model
// The Queue data structure supports two main operations
// Enqueue, which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection
// Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/head of the collection
